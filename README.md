# Hotel-Booking-cancellation-prediction

This data article describes two datasets with hotel demand data. One of the hotels (H1) is a resort hotel and the other is a city hotel (H2). Both datasets share the same structure, with 31 variables describing the 40,060 observations of H1 and 79,330 observations of H2. Each observation represents a hotel booking. Both datasets comprehend bookings due to arrive between the 1st of July of 2015 and the 31st of August 2017, including bookings that effectively arrived and bookings that were cancelled. Since this is hotel real data, all data elements pertaining hotel or costumer identification were deleted. Instead of directly extracting variables from the bookings database table, when available, the variables’ values were extracted from the bookings change log, with a timestamp relative to the day prior to arrival date. Not all variables in these datasets come from the bookings or change log database tables. Some come from other tables, and some are engineered from different variables from different tables

# Requirements
